> Consistent with the previous VR literature, we have found
that the ray cursor results in significantly faster selection
times than the point cursor, even with limited travel distances
within the volumetric display.
* **ray cursor > point cursor** in sparse environment
* most successful: **depth ray**

## Future Work
1. a 3D extension of the bubble cursor.
2. Moving selection or tracking task: eg. silk cursor
3. object manipulation: HOMER technique by Bowman.
