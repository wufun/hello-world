# Information Processing
## Attention
1. Selective attention
2. Focused attention
3. Divided attention
## Decision-making 
- behavior skills
## Selection and Control of Action
- speed-accuracy trade-off
- Fitts's law: MT = a + b log2 (2D/W)
* Index of difficulty ID: ID = log2 (2D/W)
* Index of performance IP: IP = (ID/MT)
- Steering law (simple ver.): T = a + b * A/W
# Perception
## 1. Vision
### 1.1 Visual cues
#### Monocular, Static Cues
1. relative size
2. Occlusion
3. Linear perspective
4. Aerial perspective
5. Shadows and lighting
6. Texture gradient
#### Oculomotor cues
- *muscular tention in visual system. called **accommodation and vergence**.*

#### Motion parallax
*dynamic depth cue*

#### Binocular disparity and stereopsis
- stereopsis
## 2. The Auditory System
### Auditory Cues
#### 1. Binaural Cues
#### 2. Head-Related Transfer Functions
#### 3. Reverberation
#### 4. Sound Intensity
#### 5. Vestibular Cues

## 3. Somatosensory
*The somatosensory system is generally subdivided into the **cutaneous, proprioceptive, and kinesthetic senses**, with the latter two being frequently described as just the kinesthetic sense*
### Haptic Cues
#### Tactile Cues
- vibration
#### Thermal Cues and Pain
- nociceptors
### Kinematic and Proproceptive Cues
> Proprioceptive cues provide people with information about the position and angle of body joints, which humans are able to understand well without direct visual contact. That is, even blind people are easily able to understand the relative location and angle of, for example, hands and feet.
### Effects of Tactile and Kinesthetic Cues on Haptic Perception
------------
## 4. Chemical Sensing System
Olfactory; Gustatory

## 5. Sensory Substitution and Multisensory Processing
## Evaluation Methods
### 1. Subjective Measures
- User-preference
- Cybersickness
### 2. Performance Measures
- time
- Fitts's law
### 3. Psycho-Physiological Methods
- Eye tracking
