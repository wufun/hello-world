> One of the early attempts at brining 3D viewing to a desktop envi-ronment was the Fish Tank VR approach [35], where stereo and motion parallax depth cues, are included to add to the sense of depth in the environment.
> Spatial freehand input [16] for 3D manipulations have also been explored, such as multi-finger gesture techniques with volumetric displays [12], and the freehand interactions of HoloDesk [15] and SpaceTop [19]. Such systems, and others, have supported the “natural” [36] interaction of pinching objects to directly grab and move them.
> While 3D input can be useful for full 3D manipulations [16], studies have shown that a standard mouse is still fastest for select-ing objects [22][34], even in 3D environments. 
**Object Manipulations:
1. Object Creation
2. Object Translation
3. Object Selection
4. Object Scaling
5. Object Rotation
