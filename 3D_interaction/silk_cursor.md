# Silk Cursor
1. the tracking symbol: volume
2. surface of the tracking volume: semi-transparent. *depth cue: occlusion*
---
> One of
these is the fact that the silk cursor does not block
completely the view of any object which it occludes, due to
the fact that it is semi-transparent. better than complete occlusion.
----
> The second point relates to the fact that the silk cursor
provides discrete, rather than continuous, levels of depth information.T his is in contrast to stereoscopic displays,
which are able to provide information not only about
wherher one object is farther away than another object but
also to a significant extent by how much they are separated
in space, by means of binocular depth scaling.
