**Fitts' law:**
- one dimensional model.  
- with the target wigth W being the only movement constraint.
> our goal here is to obtain a thorough understanding of the
factors that govern pointing at trivariate targets in 3D, and to
develop a predictive model that accurately characterizes such
behavior.

> Accot and Zhai [1] found that increasing H reduced MT only
when it was smaller than W, but increasing W reduced MT
regardless of H. In other words, the W-H ratio was
significant. For trivariate targets in 3D, there are three such
interactions which must be examined (W-H, W-D, H-D).

slower than moving left and right for selecting targets; that
the target width was more critical than the height and depth
of the target;
