## Depth Perception and Visual Cues
### 1. Visual depth cues
(1) monocular cues\
&ensp;&ensp;i. pictorial depth cues\
&ensp;&ensp;ii. motion cues\
(2) binocular cues
### 2. Oculomotor depth cues
*ocular near triad* :\
Accommodation; Convergence; Pupillary constriction
- Cross-linked behavior between accommodation and convergence\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Measures: AC/A or CA/C ratios
#### 2.1 Accommodation and monocular acuity
* depth of focus
* hyperfocal distance
- factors influencing these
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;1. Pupil size
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;2. Contrast and spatial frequency of the target.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;3. Aberrations
#### 2.2 Convergence and stereoscopic acuity
**stereoscopic acuity is affected by:**\
1. Target luminance
2. Spatial frequency of the target
3. Angular distance from fixation
4. Observation time

## Quality and visual comfort of 3D display
### 1. Types of 3D displays and related 3D characteristics
- Binocular displays
- Multi-view displays
- Integral imaging displays
- Volumetric displays
- Holographic displays

### 2. Crucial depth cues
- the investigation of human factors and visual comfort
> Based on our experience, natural, full-parallax motion cues and consistent oculomotor cues of vergence and
accommodation are likely to be the most decisive factors for a comfortable 3D viewing experience.
#### 2.1 Natural motion pparallax
#### 2.2 Consistent oculomotor cues - Matched vergence and accommodation
* natural viewing 
* stereoscopic viewing\
@@@ **the confict between accomodation and convergence.**
> For all efforts, the conflict between accommodation and convergence, which is inherent in all 3D stereo
displays can only be weakened but not resolved.
### Seereal's Holographic Display Technology
> The key idea of our
solution to electro-holography is to reconstruct a limited angular spectrum of the wave field of the 3D object, which is adapted in size to about the humanâ€™s eye entrance pupil.
