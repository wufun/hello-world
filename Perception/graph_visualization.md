> 3D depth cues allowed participants to see paths in graphs containing 333 nodes with better than 92% accuracy. More experienced observers were able to see graphs up to 1000 nodes with better than 90% accuracy. With 2D viewing and 2D spring layout a 33 node graphs yielded comparable error rates. Thus, we find roughly an order of magnitude increase in the size of the graph that can be “read” (where we consider “reading” to be the identification of short paths) when 3D viewing is available using stereo and motion depth cues.
