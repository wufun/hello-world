## The Horopter
1. Vieth-Muller Circle
2. Measuring the Horopter
3. Relationship of the Horopter to Panum's fusional area

### 1. the Vieth-Muller circle

### 2. Measuring the horpoter
&ensp;&ensp;1. Haplopic method
&ensp;&ensp;2. Nonius method
&ensp;&ensp;3. Apparent front-parallel plane (AFPP) method

#### 1. Haplopic method
> The haplopic method (method of the region of singular binocular vision) is based on the primary definition of corresponding points; retinal points which correspond give rise to identical visual directions and, as a consequence, single vision.

#### 2. Nonius method
#### 3. Apparent front-parallel plane (AFPP) method

#### Relationship of the Horopter to Panum’s Fusional Area

### Aniseikonia
> Aniseikonia describes a subject’s spatial perception when there is a difference in retinal image size of the same object between the two eyes.
