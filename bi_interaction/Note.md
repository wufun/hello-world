**three universal interaction tasks in a 3D user interface design:**
1. selection of an object
2. viewpoint motion control
3. manipulation of the object
-----------------------
**Performance metrics:**
*typical ones:* task completion time; task failure/error rate
* Fitts' law
* distance error from a target location
* Heuristic evaluation

**Aiding Fidelity of Actor Motion in the Virtual Studio**
* using vibrotactile haptic devices for dectection of virtual object.

## Bimanual Haptic Interaction
### 1. Bimanual Haptic Perception
### 2. Bimanual Motor Control
(1) Guiard's Kinematic Chain Model
(2)
> asymmetric techniques are more suitable
for tasks that are more cognitively demanding or that last
for longer periods of time
### 3. Bimanual Cognition
> Using two hands
can also reduce the gap between novices and experts compared
to the use of only one hand, as was shown with a navigation/
selection task
### 4. Benefits of Bimanuality for Interaction
- it harnesses better our existing skills, that
we use in everyday life.
- it increases task accuracy compared to the use of one hand through two-handed proprioceptive feedback
**Negative Effects**
> when
the tasks applied by the two hands are not sufficiently integrated,
an effect of “division of attention” occurs between
the two tasks and performance may decrease significantly.

**Summary**
> The integration of tasks between both
hands appears to be a complex problem, as there are different
possible integration schemes: visual, motor and
conceptual.
