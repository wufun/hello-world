**3 classes of Manual activities:**
1. Asymmetric and unimanual;
2. Asymmetric but bimanual;
3. Symmetric and bimanual;
## Some Higher Order Principles Governing the Asymmetry of Human Bimanual Gestures
1. Right-to-left Spatial Reference in Manual Motion
2. Left-Right Contrast in the Spatial-Temporal Scale of Motion
3. Left-Hand Precedence in Action

# The Kinematic Chain as a Model of Bimanual Cooperation in Differentiated Gestures
- Aim: describe the logic of division of labor that appears to govern the variety of human bimanual asymmetrical actions.
- 2 basic assumptions:\
&ensp;&ensp;(1) likens the two hands to a pair of abstract motors. \
&ensp;&ensp;(2) two motors tend to be assembled in series, thus forming a kinematic chain.

**1. The Hands as Abstract Motors**\
**2. Assembling Two Motors: Orthogonal, Parallel and Serial Assemblies**\
**3. The Kinematic Chain Model**
1. Distal-to-proximal spatial reference
2. Proximal-distal contrast in the spatial-temporal scale of motion
3. Proximal precedence
