* humans perform actions not only to bring them closer
to the physical goals of a task (**pragmatic action**), but also to
facilitate perception and cognition (**epistemic action**).
* This “ray casting” method of selecting
3D targets using a 2D cursor is widely employed in 3D
graphics applications and has been shown to be superior to
selection using 3D cursors
* Our experiments and informal study have shown that having
the *non-dominant hand* operate a subset of possible *camera
controls* in 3D graphics interfaces can be beneficial over a
range of tasks. **3D selection; 3D docking; 3D painting** 
* The results of experiment 2, however, caution
that when the interaction style deviates from Guiard’s
KC model and both hands begin to operate in a symmetric
manner(move both hands simultaneously), temporal benefits may not be immediately apparent.
