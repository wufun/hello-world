> In this paper, we describe and evaluate a bimanual interaction technique for desktop 3D graphics applications which not only increases the input control bandwidth but also enhances user perception of the virtual 3D scene.
## Background
### Depth Cues in Virtual 3D Scenes
### A Model of Bimanual Interaction 
*Kinematic Chain*

## Experiment
* 3D selection; 
* 3D docking.
