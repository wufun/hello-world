experimented on bimanual selection techniques and
reported better accuracy with symmetric techniques, while
suggesting that asymmetric techniques are more suitable
for tasks that are more cognitively demanding or that last

An element of classification for 3D interaction techniques
is the taxonomy of Bowman [109], which defines
**4 main classes of interaction:** \
navigation, selection,
manipulation and system control.
