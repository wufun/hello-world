### Grice's Maxims:
- All people feel that conversations should be guided by four basic principles that constitute the rules for polite interaction: 
- QUALITY   QUANTITY    RELEVANCE   CLARITY
#### 1. Quality: truth; accuracy.
#### 2. Quantity: not too much or too little;
#### 3. Relevance: 
- Interfaces that provide a single way of presenting information, without taking into account **MULTIPLE goals** of users, risk violating the rule of relevance.
#### 4. Clarity: not obscure.
