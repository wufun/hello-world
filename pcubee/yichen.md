# Introduction
## 1. Contributions
### 1.1 Evaluation of Trajectory-Based Tasks in pCubee
> whether a model similar to the steering law for 2D tunnel
task can be identified to describe user performance for 3D trajectory-based
tasks.
### 1.2 A New Hand-Held Perspective-Corrected Cubic Display System Design
> we completely
redesigned the perspective-corrected display system incorporating
OLED display panel, FPGA display controller and 3D-printed chassis.

# Related Work
## 1. Geometric 3D Display Technologies
- FTVR displays rely heavily on motion parallax in
order to create their 3D effect, because they essentially only generate 2D
images. 
## 2. User Interface Design for Geometric 3D Display
- it is already confirmed by multiple
researchers [15, 20, 25] that traditional mouse is not an effective interface
for object manipulation in virtual 3D environment.
- Previous work [6, 12, 24, 36] has already shown that the
time taken to select an object using a 3D point cursor in volumetric display
follows Fitts law, and will thus be a function of the travel distance. 

# Evaluation of Trajectory-Based Tasks in pCubee
## 1. Wire-Tracing Task
> the tunnel task is a good
abstraction to represent a common type of tasks where a constrained trajectory
has to be followed.
- in our studies we would like to test the effects of three
potential factors on user performance: \
(1) radius of the ring, \
(2) length of the wire, and \
(3) curvature of the wire.
## 2. User Study 1: Effect of Ring Radius
## 3. User Study 2: Effects of Wire Length and Curvature
* *Combining results from both studies, we can confirm that wire-tracing task follows a model similar to 2D steering law*

# Potential Application
## 1. Personal Entertainment
## 2. Design and Prototyping
> Using direct mapping, the user would be able to control a virtual
stylus to do 3D drawing, sculpturing and assembling.
## 3. Scientific Simulation and Visualization
> they can select, mark and manipulate the 3D data with direct mapping,
turning pCubee into a interactive simulation platform for tasks such
as surgery operations.
## 4. Collaborative Working

# Future Directions

## 1. Tracking Technology
- calibration of the tracking system
## 2. Cross-Screen Multi-Touch
## 3. Trajectory-Based Tasks
- As pointed out previously, tasks involving free movement in virtual 3D environment
are inherently diffcult due to lack of constrains and affordances.
- It would be useful to investigate
both virtual and physical trajectory-based tasks with varying diffculty levels,
and understand any performance difference as well as factors causing the
gap.
## 4. Comparison of Geometric Display Technologies
- Based on steering law model.
