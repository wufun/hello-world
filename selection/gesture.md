- *freehand movements with a single camera.*
- **Challenges**
1. accuracy
2. fine movements
3. tactile feedback
4. gesture delimiter
# 1. Related Work
## 1.1 Selection on a 2D surface
* pie menus reduce selection time and errors compared to linear menus
* marking menus are faster than linear menus
* target or goal crossing technique  *faster than point and click.*
## 1.2 Selection with 3D tracking devices
- Ray-casting have **better** target selection performance than hand extension approach
- moving forward and backward for selection was significantly slower than other directions
- Depth Ray: 1-step approach faster than other 2-step techniques.\
outperformed other one-step approaches *eg. point cursor and 3D bubble cursor.*
## 1.3 Freehand interaction
- intuitive but needs more precise operation
# 2. Touching the third dimension with freehand gestures
*bare hands tracked by a single remote camera without wearing any markers or holding any devices*
## 2.1 Design space comparison
