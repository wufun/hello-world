> The
concept allows controlled translation of virtual objects in an
**increased interaction volume**, not restricted by *armâ€™s length* and
without the use of *buttons* for reeling or confusing algorithms for
translation scaling.
- **The Sense of Presence** in immersive virtual environments
depends not only on quality and fidelity of the **output devices** (e.g.
stereo projections, helmets, haptic feedback) but also on the **range
of possibilities** and **the intuitiveness of interaction**.
- Bowman:
1. arm-extension techniques
2. ray-casting techniques
- limitation: rather **small** or distant objects
- selection and manipulation tasks should be separately due to "lever effect" (distance between hands and objects)
### Benefits
1. the nearly unlimited range of interaction volume
2. the possibility of grabbing partially or totally occluded objects
3. nonlinear mappings
