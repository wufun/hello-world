- Purpose: Avoid hand or tracker **jitter** caused by ray-casting selection, also the inavailability of **high-precision pointing.**
- support interaction in a highly cluttered environment
### 2 phases: 
1st: spatial and in-context // Sphere-casting \
2nd: out-of-context// quad-menu 
### **❤️❤️❤️Kopper's predictive model of distal pointing:**
**a similar model for distal pointing tasks. 
input device is remotely located wrt display area and the pointing is done in a direct fashion.**
1. angular amplitude of the movement
2. the angular width of the target
### &&&& Tips:
1. By not showing the distractors in the beginning, the user could find the target location before starting it, reducing any cognitive time to segment the target from the distractors to a minimum.
2. trade-off between immediate techniques and progressive refinement techniques.
3. sphere problem: depth! $$$*solution: cone or cylinder*
4. not suitable for objects depending on the **spatial context and object location.**$$$ *zooming to solve it*
