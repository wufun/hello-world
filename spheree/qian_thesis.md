## Note

1. Spheree: a spherical FTVR with 360-degree visibility.
2. FTVR provides motion parallax with a high-resolution desktop display.
3. seamless motion parallax with 360 degrees of visibility.
4. a spherical display using multiple mini-projectors which can increase the display resolution and make the system scalable.
5. we calibrate the system with an automatic calibration approach that achieves sub-millimeter accuracy.
---------------
* 3D visualization: use a mental rotation task to measure **spatial perception**.
* 3D interaction: use **Fitt's Law** to design and evaluate 3D selection techniques.\
/*a well-established method for comparing hci for pointing and selection./*
* a spherical display is a natural fit for bimanual interactions.
